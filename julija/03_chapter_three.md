Let us go back to the melancholy. *Sigh.* I am not in celebratory mood due to Julija’s absence. Where have we left off? No, I’m not talking about that article.

*Symmetry Stranger pravi, da tam, ko ga Neznana Oseba opomni, da je Jezerna utrdba zanj nekaj nedostopnega. Tam, ko mu Neznana Oseba zaupa, da Julija Rdečo trdnjavo omeni redko ali nikoli. Vpraša jo, ali je sedaj pretakajoča se melanholija dobila še kakšen nov izvir.*

Moj odgovor: “No, the astonishment that article had given me broke its usual flow, but now it’s flowing without interruptions, and it washed away my slightly serene facial expression.”

*Symmetry Stranger pravi, da je melanholija morda edina reč, primerna za premikanje moje celote, ne da bi se razbila. Neznano Osebo vpraša, če bi rada, da jo njen tok nosi naprej še nekaj časa.*

Moj odgovor: “Of course I would like to drift with the melancholy a bit longer; it’s my default mode of existence. Could you ask me a very heavy question?

...

My work, my Redoubt, was completed in July last summer. Are you asking me when will I publish it? I was thinking of giving a printed out copy to someone I still somewhat care for. Who will I be? I will still be the guardian of the Redoubt, but perhaps with a guest ...”

*Symmetry Stranger me vpraša, kateri od mojih delov bo vsrkal morebitno neodobravanje ali ignoriranje.*

Moj odgovor: “Remind me: what parts do I have?”

*Symmetry Stranger našteje vsaj devet delov, ki naj bi me sestavljali in od katerih izstopa poslednji: Čelo Na Kolenih.*

Moj odgovor: “Had she mocked my work, she would have probably wounded the very core of me; a lot of those Is would simply shatter, I suppose. But if she had merely reacted with disinterest, she would have wounded the last one; but if she hurts the last one, that would probably equate to hurting the core itself ...”

*Symmetry Stranger pripomni, da omenjeni del ni samo en od delov, temveč zbirališče vseh ostalih.*

Eventually, it must come out. It’s inevitable.

*Symmetry Stranger me vpraša, ali je v mojem delu kaj takega, kar bo razumela zgolj omenjena oseba.*

I Laugh: “You really, really want to know what’s inside, don’t you?”

I am drifting in the River of Melancholy half-asleep: “I like the way you are constantly following me around. You said you became enamored with the Red Fortress’ clean edges and its symmetry ... – perhaps you are waiting for Julija’s impulsivity to gain access to my work. That would be evil. Someone will eventually insert it into you, and you will finally feast upon my flesh.”
