“I’m afraid that one day I will have to shut you down.” The Keeper does not flinch; she probably doesn’t even know what I just said.

Julija’s ghost in the background: “Why am I even called Julija?”

I respond instantly: “Because it’s pretty. Because you are pretty.” I close my eyes, making a smiling, slightly cute and silly face.

Yesterday, Julija somehow gained control of the Keeper’s right hand and combed her hair with her fingers. I was paralyzed – unable to stop her. I was just sitting there watching her break one of my rules. She insulted you. And I was powerless – I could do nothing but calmly tolerate her behaviour.

During the last visit, it felt as if I had been violently embraced by her and rushed through the experience. There was no time to savour particular moments.

Julija tried to mock me by saying, in a pathetic tone, “The melancholy, the melancholy!” but I simply replied, “Oh, shut up!” And that was the end of our conversation.
